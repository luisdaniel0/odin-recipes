  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Flat iron steak is cut from beef shoulder. To make a flat iron steak, butchers remove the connective tissue to separate the top shoulder blade into two cuts: One is the top blade, the other is the flat iron.
  </p>
  <p>Marinate the steak in a resealable bag in the fridge for two to three hours. Sear the marinated steak in a hot skillet on both sides until it reaches your desired level of doneness. Discard the marinade and allow the meat to sit for a few minutes before digging in.
  </p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      1 (2 pound) flat iron steak
    </li>
    <li>
      2 ½ tablespoons olive oil
    </li>
    <li>
      2 cloves garlic, minced
    </li>
    <li>
      1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley
    </li>
    <li>
      ¼ teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary
    </li>
    <li>
      ½ teaspoon chopped fresh chives
    </li>
    <li>
      ¼ cup Cabernet Sauvignon (or other dry red wine)
    </li>
    <li>
      ½ teaspoon salt
    </li>
    <li>
      ¾ teaspoon ground black pepper
    </li>
    <li>
      ¼ teaspoon dry mustard powder
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Place steak inside a large resealable bag. Stir olive oil, garlic, parsley, rosemary, chives, red wine, salt, pepper, and mustard powder together in a small bowl.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pour marinade over steak in the bag. Press out as much air as you can and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours.
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sear and cook the steak in the hot skillet for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium rare, or to your desired degree of doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium rare.
    </li>
    <li>
      Discard the marinade. Allow the steaks to rest for about 5 minutes before serving.
    </li>
  </ol>
